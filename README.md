## Link-Hub - Share your links easily!

A web application that allows me to easily upload links and can be accessed on other devices in the network. To enhance the security, I integrated VirusTotal to check if the uploaded links are malicious or legit, providing an extra layer of security before I use them on any of my device.

### 🔍 Key Features:

**Add Links**: Easily submit any URL to get a safety report.

**VirusTotal Integration**: Automatically fetches and displays the VirusTotal safety score.

**Manage Links**: Simple interface to view and delete links.

### 🔧 Technologies Used:

Flask (Python)

SQLite

HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)

JavaScript (jQuery)
